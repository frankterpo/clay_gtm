# GTM Engineer Challenge: The Post-Webinar Sprint ⚡️

*Edited 1h ago*

We’re very excited to have you with us for the Super Day!

This final stretch is all about giving you the chance to showcase your GTM intelligence and Clay wizardry, while giving you a glimpse into what it’s really like to work at Peec AI.

---

## 🚨 The Scenario

The webinar just finished **10 minutes ago**.

The content was great, and engagement was high, but the clock is ticking. We are sitting on a pile of raw data, and **every minute that passes, these hot leads are getting colder**.

We need to strike while the iron is hot.

We don't just want to "send emails" – we want to create a **hyper-personalized experience** based on how they interacted with us.

## 🛠️ The Stack & Rules

You have access to a Clay workspace, but we want to see your full potential.

- **Clay is your HQ:** Use it to set up CSVs, enrich data, and build your primary flows.
- **Use Your Full Toolkit:** You are **allowed and encouraged** to use any other tools in your stack (e.g., Python, Make, Zapier, OpenAI playground, etc.).
- **Be Creative:** Don't just follow the standard playbook. If you can find a unique angle in the data or a creative way to segment these leads, do it.

## 🎯 Your goal

Design and implement a data and campaign setup that would let a GTM team run a highly targeted follow-up to this webinar.

You have **90 minutes**. How efficient can you be?

## Tasks

### 1. Data cleaning & joining

- Import the following into a Google Sheets / Excel:
  - `registered list.csv`
  - `attend list.csv`
  - `did not attend list.csv`
  - `Copy of Q&A transcript.csv`
  - `poll responses.csv`
  - `emoji reaction.csv`
  - `CRM.csv`
- Clean the data!

### 2. Segmentation logic

Define which segments you’d create for a follow-up campaign. At minimum, consider:

- Brands vs. agencies

For each segment, be able to describe:

- Business logic (how you identify them from the data)
- Why this segment matters for our GTM motion
- Any additional enrichments you would run (e.g. firmographics, role, tech stack)

### 3. Clay flow design

Design the Clay setup to support this:

- Tables, key columns, and joins
- Enrichment steps (which data you’d fetch and why)
- Any quality checks you’d include (e.g. handling missing domains, bad emails)

**Optional (strong plus once you feel you nailed the other flow):** Implement social signals into your flow (or tell us how it would look like and where it makes sense)

### 4. Messaging & campaign plan

For each main segment, provide:

- Message angle (what you’d say and why it resonates)
- Primary CTA
- 1 example email or LinkedIn message per segment

Explain how timing and number of touchpoints would differ between segments (e.g. customers vs. net-new)

## FINAL Output

Deliverables by the end of the challenge:

- A cleaned CSV/table spec (what columns and rows your “final” list would have)
- Efficient and effective Clay flow
- Draft messages for each main segment
